#Madagascar, A Country On The Edge

##Introduction
It was on exiting the Analamazaotra Special Reserve that I realised that Madagascar might well have no future at all. Analamazaotra is lucky to be part of the 6% of Madagascar that is protected in some form - here poaching and logging are illegal. But outside the visitor centre, easily visible on the other side of the road, three plumes of smoke rise. They are logging eucalyptus.
Eucalpytus is not a native tree to Madagascar.
