#Madagascar, A Country On The Edge

##Introduction
It was on exiting the Analamazaotra Special Reserve that I realised that Madagascar might well have no future at all. Analamazaotra is lucky to be part of the 6% of Madagascar that is protected in some form - here poaching and logging are illegal. But outside the visitor centre, easily visible on the other side of the road, three plumes of smoke rise. They are logging eucalyptus.
Eucalpytus is not a native tree to Madagascar. Madagascar's native flora has been logged indiscriminately - at most 10% of the original forest that used to cover Madagascar remains. Whilst Madagascar's native hardwood trees such as Rosewood and Ebony can command high market prices, only the least accessible members of these species have not already been felled, and loggers turn to foreign plants such as Eucalyptus which grow at much higher rates, at the cost of biodiversity, sustainability, and long-term gain.
